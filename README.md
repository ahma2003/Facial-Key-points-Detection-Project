* **Overview**
This project focuses on detecting facial key points (also known as facial landmarks) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate detection. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to make it user-friendly. The main goal is to identify key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline.

* **Features**

-Detect facial key points: Identify key landmarks on a face using a CNN model. 

-Visualize key points: Overlay the detected key points on the face for visualization.

-Graphical User Interface: User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.

-Real-time detection: Perform real-time key points detection using a webcam.

* **Technologies Used**
  Programming Language: Python
  
  Libraries:
  TensorFlow/Keras (for the CNN model),
  OpenCV (for image processing),
  Tkinter (for the GUI),
  NumPy
